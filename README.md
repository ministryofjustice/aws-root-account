# AWS Root Account

This repository holds infrastructure as code for the Ministry of Justice
[AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/) root account, and
two supporting accounts: organisation-security, and organisation-logging.

## AWS Organizations

All accounts defined here form part of the MOJ's [AWS Organization](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/),
allowing us to use [certain services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services_list.html)
for organisational audit, governance, security, and cost optimisation.
