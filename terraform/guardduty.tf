# Accounts to attach from the AWS Organization
# This is currently done by adding accounts on a one-by-one basis as
# we need to onboard people singularly rather than all at once.
# In the future we can replace all of this with a for_each on a
# data.aws_organizations_organization.example.accounts[*].id data resource,
# and auto_enable will be turned on so new accounts won't need to be added here.
# Any account added here in the meanwhile will have GuardDuty enabled in:
# - eu-west-2 (guardduty.tf)
# - eu-west-1 (guardduty-eu-west-1.tf)
#
# The configuration for the publishing destination is in guardduty-publishing-destination.tf,
# which has an eu-west-2 bucket that all regional GuardDuty configurations publish to.
