# Service Control Policies #
############################

# Note: Every AWS account must have at least *one* service control policy set. By default, this is
# "FullAWSAccess", which gives full access to all AWS services, and is automatically created.
# This cannot be edited or imported, so is not included in this Terraform.
# See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.html for more information

# Before creating or editing a service control policy, please read how policy inheritence works in AWS Organizations:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_inheritance.html
